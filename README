This project is a forked version of BSDiff, as taken from the Chromium project
at SVN Revision 122769. See README.chromium for background on its origins.

Significant changes after the fork include:

- Changing the BSDiff file format to support file owner, group, and permission
  information.
- Adding more robust error handling.
- Adding a new program, bsdump, that outputs BSDiff header information.
- Converting the core functionality into a library, libbsdiff, with public API
  functions make_bsdiff_delta() and apply_bsdiff_delta().
